    testimonial:
      body: |
        We are a startup. I was looking for strong
        foundations to start building my web application in terms of right
        technology and best practices. Having worked closely with Noufal and
        his team for two months, I can safely say that I could not have asked
        for more. Noufalâ€™s works was on-time, to spec and importantly with-in
        budget. Through out the entire engagement Noufal and his team showed
        100% availability and delivered quality work in the end. I wouldn't
        think twice hire him again whenever there is a need or recommend to
        others.

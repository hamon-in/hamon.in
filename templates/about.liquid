    title: What we do
    body: |
      The best infrastructure is invisible.  It does its work and stays
      in the limelight while providing the foundation for customer facing
      applications to run.  Good infrastructure leverages automation and
      has makes the computer do most of the work leaving the people to
      focus on the creative part of the enterprise. 
      
      Hamon draws on its experience in automation and infrastructure to
      build custom solutions that allow our clients to automate critical
      parts of their infrastructure.
